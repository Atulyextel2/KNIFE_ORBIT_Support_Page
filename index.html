      <h2>About Knife Orbit</h2>
      <p>A quick overview of what the game is and how it plays.</p>

      <h3>Core Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
        In Knife Orbit, knives rotate around a central fruit core. You tap the screen to throw new knives at the core
        while avoiding collisions with blades already stuck there. Timing, spacing, and pattern recognition are key.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast-paced one-tap arcade gameplay.</li>
        <li>Orbit patterns that become faster and more challenging as you progress.</li>
        <li>Short, replayable runs focused on beating your high score.</li>
        <li>Clean hyper-casual visuals and responsive feel.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="frequently-asked-questions" class="card">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>Quick answers to common questions about Knife Orbit.</p>

      <h3>How do I play Knife Orbit?</h3>
      <p>
        Tap anywhere on the screen to throw a knife toward the center. Your goal is to stick all required knives
        into the fruit core without hitting any existing knives. If a new knife hits an existing one, the run ends.
      </p>

      <h3>The game feels very fast. Is there a difficulty setting?</h3>
      <p>
        Knife Orbit is designed as a quick-reaction arcade game. Difficulty increases gradually based on your progress.
        There is no manual difficulty slider at launch, but balance and pacing may be adjusted in updates based on feedback.
      </p>

      <h3>Will I lose progress if I reinstall the game?</h3>
      <p>
        Progress handling may depend on platform and store configuration. If you are worried about losing local progress,
        we recommend keeping the app installed until you no longer need your current scores or unlocks.
      </p>

      <h3>Is Knife Orbit online or offline?</h3>
      <p>
        Knife Orbit is primarily designed for quick offline play sessions. Some builds or future updates may use
        network connectivity for analytics, updates, or additional features, but core gameplay does not require
        you to be online.
